# C++ On Sea 2022 - Trip Report
Folkestone, UK, July 4-7  

This year, I was delighted to return (on-site) to the **C++ On Sea** conference. This post is a summary of the sessions I attended and enjoyed.  
Check out this [separate post](./tripreport.html) for my general impressions of the conference (trip report summary).  

## Plenary Sessions

This year's plenary sessions were:  

### Hana Dus√≠kov√° - [Lightning Updates](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/sessions/keynote-lightning-updates.html)  
Hana presented a nifty custom differential update system (think "Git") as a showcase for cool C++20 features usage. Her skills of progressively walking us through the code and meticulously highlighting the important bits are legendary - enough said.

### Kevlin Henney - [For the Sake of Complexity](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/sessions/midnote-for-the-sake-of-complexity.html)  
For me, Kevlin's keynotes are the highlight of any conference. As usual, he didn't disappoint.üòÑ  
A fantastic overview of the complexity in software systems: from our code, from the nature of software development to the detail of coding habits, from design practices through to the core language.

### Jason Turner - [Making C++ Fun, Safe, and Accessible](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/sessions/endnote-making-cpp-fun-safe-and-accessible.html)  
C++ has a reputation for being hard to learn with annoying errors and dangerous memory issues. Jason explores various ways in which we make C++ fun and safe and accessible to a larger audience.

### Victor Ciura - [C++ MythBusters](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/sessions/plenary-cpp-mythbusters.html)  
... and my own session üòÑ  
I dissected a few of the most popular C++ myths to a level of detail not possible on Twitter‚Ä¶ and without the stigma of newb/duplicate/eyeroll one might experience when asking these questions on StackOverflow. The familiar ‚ÄúBusted‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlausible‚Äù, or ‚ÄúConfirmed‚Äù verdicts on each myth. 
I probably started some controversy and hopefully constructive discussions around a few sensitive topics in contemporary C++.

## Sessions I liked

Out of the 3-day x 4 tracks [schedule](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/schedule/), full of interesting talks, I managed to attended 15 sessions that I found very engaging. Here they are, in chronological order.   

### Walter E Brown - [A Medley of C++](https://cpponsea.uk/2022/sessions/a-medley-of-cpp.html)  
It is a real privilege to listen to Walter's stories, both on stage and especially on the hallway, during breaks. An industry veteran with tons of experience using various systems, languages, techniques and a wonderful human being eager to share his experience to younger generations. This set of short presentations were both captivating and informative. A must see!
