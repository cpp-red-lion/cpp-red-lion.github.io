## The Conference

[C++ on Sea](https://cpponsea.uk) is an international C++ conference taking place by the sea, in the UK. 
It started in 2019, kept going (online) during the pandemic and now returned in a hybrid format in 2022.  
Right from the start it attracted great speakers and a fantastic mix of attendees from all over Europe and even US/Canada.

## The Venue

C++ on Sea is hosted at the [Leas Cliff Hall](http://leascliffhall.co.uk) in Folkestone in Kent, UK, overlooking the English Channel. This historic seaside town is also home to The Channel tunnel and, as such, has excellent links to the rest of Europe.  
The Leas Cliff Hall is a working theater that also has a dedicated conference suite. Built into the cliffs, and with floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the sea on three sides, the views are spectacular (if the classic British fog doesn't get in the way ðŸ˜„).
