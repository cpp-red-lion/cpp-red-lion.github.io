## The Venue

C++ on Sea is hosted at the [Leas Cliff Hall](http://leascliffhall.co.uk) in Folkestone in Kent, UK, overlooking the English Channel. This historic seaside town is also home to the channel tunnel and, as such, has excellent links to the rest of Europe. 
The Leas Cliff Hall is a working theater that also has a dedicated conference suite. Built into the cliffs, and with floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the sea on three sides, the views are spectacular.
