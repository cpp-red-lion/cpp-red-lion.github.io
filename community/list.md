In November 2017, I started a local **C++ User Group** in my hometown of Craiova, Romania (EU).

I also founded [Romania C++ User Group](https://www.facebook.com/rocpp/) - the national umbrella user group for all Romanian C++ user groups. It serves as a central hub for information sharing and representation.

## <img src="https://ciura.ro/img/aoc.png" height="64"> Advent of Code Meetup

Since 2018, I'm the organizer of the local group of programmers solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.  
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) consisting of a set of 25 Christmas themed puzzles, one each day, starting from December 1st, each year. The puzzles make up a story arc and build on each other, challenging programmers to solve them using the programming languages/tools of their choice. Some of them are casual/quick to solve, some are really tough algorithmic problems, but the experience of solving all of them makes each month of December pass by quickly and we have a lot of fun ü§ì.   
  
Every January, after the holidays, I [organize a meetup](https://www.caphyon.ro/advent-of-code-2019-meetup.html) where we spend a few hours together and share stories and code about our challenges in solving the Advent of Code puzzles.  
Here are a few pictures from our last meetup, in January 2020: [AoC Meetup](https://ciura.ro/presentations/2020/Meetups/Advent%20of%20Code/)

#### STL Algorithms - Principles and Practice [ üì∑ Pictures](/presentations/2019/STL Workshop DCTI/pics)  

Also, in June-July every year, in collaboration with my friends in academia, I organize and teach a workshop: Open4Tech Summer School for Software.

## Scholarships

Since 2016, I‚Äôve managed the **Scholarships program** of my employer [CAPHYON](https://www.caphyon.com) where we select students from our local UNI and support them financially to study and participate at international conferences, contests (eg. ACM, ONIS), workshops and award them for outstanding technical research projects.  
More details about this program on our [blog](https://www.caphyon.ro/burse-private.html) and on the CS Department [bulletin board](http://stud.inf.ucv.ro/2019/04/festivitate-de-premiere-studenti-informaticieni-de-exceptie-2019/)
