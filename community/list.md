In November 2017, I started a local **C++ User Group** in my hometown of Craiova, Romania (EU).

I also founded [Romania C++ User Group](https://www.facebook.com/rocpp/) - the national umbrella user group for all Romanian C++ user groups. It serves as a central hub for information sharing and representation.

## Scholarships

Since 2016, I‚Äôve managed the **Scholarships program** of my employer [CAPHYON](https://www.caphyon.com) where we select students from our local UNI and support them financially to study and participate at international conferences, contests (eg. ACM, ONIS), workshops and award them for outstanding technical research projects.  
More details about this program on our [blog](https://www.caphyon.ro/burse-private.html) and on the CS Department [bulletin board](http://stud.inf.ucv.ro/2019/04/festivitate-de-premiere-studenti-informaticieni-de-exceptie-2019/)
