Title:  **Tuning SQLite Workflows**  
  
Abstract:  
  
SQLite is the goto data store for local storage and caching for desktop apps. We all take it for granted that it's very fast and disk space frugal. We even invest a lot of time building abstractions & object models on top of it.  
But when our application workloads stress the boundaries of performance, we need to start looking beyond default configurations and begin tuning the database for optimum access.  
Come join me to find out about the experiments we did last summer, to squeeze performance out of the SQLite DB we use as a cache for VC++ project code-browse tokens. Learn what worked, what didn't and what we plan to pursue next in this area.
